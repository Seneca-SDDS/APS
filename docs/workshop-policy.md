# Workshop Promotion Policy

- One of the criteria to be eligible to pass the APS145 course is to **complete a set minimum number of workshops**. Please consult your course **ADDENDA** for details. If you complete more than the minimum, your best top minimum number will be used in the calculation of your overall workshops grade
- You must submit a minimum of one presentation
- Workshop individual, group, and presentations will be evaluated using the **published workshop rubrics** - see the posted rubrics on your course management system (Blackboard)

## Workshops

Workshops are divided into two parts. The **INDIVIDUAL** part is worth 40% of the workshop, while the **SUB-GROUP SOLUTION** part is worth the remaining 60% of the workshop grade.

### Individual Logic Part

- Every student **MUST** submit their assigned individual part to earn a grade in the workshop
- Individual work is due by **end of day (23:59 EST) 2-days after the ASSIGNED date** (workshops are officially assigned in your scheduled class the week before)
- Individual logic assignments are to be done **INDIVIDUALLY**
- Members who do not submit work on-time will receive a **ZERO grade for the ENTIRE workshop**
- Members who receive a zero grade for the individual part (even if you submitted work), will **NOT be eligible to receive grades for the group solution part** and it will **NOT count towards a completed workshop**

### Sub-Group Solution Part

- The group solution must be **based on** the combination of all the individual parts done by each individual member. It is **minimally expected the group will work together to further test, refine, and enhance all logic to create an overall uniform cohesive solution.**
- The group solution portion of the workshop grade will apply **only to the students who earned a grade > 0 for their individual assigned part**
- The group solution is due by the **end of the class for the assigned workshop week** (unless otherwise instructed by your professor).
- **The full name of all CONTRIBUTING members** MUST be stated at the top of all physical pages (or at the top of the first page **IN THE FILE DOCUMENT** if being submitted via email)

  - List **only the members who actually contributed** towards your group solution (members who simply "attend" but do nothing should not receive credit)

    :::warning WARNING
    Using a members individual logic part alone does not count as contributing!

    **Active contribution is achieved during group interaction when the refinements, testing, and improvements are done as a group.**
    :::

- If not submitted on-time, a **ZERO grade** will be applied for the group portion of the workshop
- If the submitted solution is essentially a copy of the individual parts merely thrown together containing no effort to properly integrate as a seamless overall solution, a **ZERO grade** will be applied for the group portion of the workshop.
- **Under no circumstances is the group solution to be done by an individual.**
  - The group solution is expected to be done by **ALL members working together** refining and testing the logic to ensure the solution properly addresses the workshop problem.

:::important NOTE
Do you have missing members or members who did not contribute?

It is still the **responsibility of the GROUP** to provide a **FULL SOLUTION** which may require completing logic that was not done by other individual members. In these situations, a **10% bonus** will be applied.
:::

:::warning REMINDER
If your INDIVIDUAL portion of a workshop earned a zero grade, you will not receive group marks and the workshop will NOT be counted towards the minimum number of completed workshops as stated in the course addenda and course promotion policy
:::

## Video Presentation

- Presentations are due **6-days AFTER the group solution**. That is, **by the end of day (23:59 EST) 1-day BEFORE the following workshop class**
- Each student MUST do a video presentation **at least once** by the end of the term and should **minimally** consist of the following:

  - A **description of the problem** and a **summary of the solution** in **non-technical terms**. You should assume your audience is non-technical and interested in using your application solution.
  - A good attempt to market your application solution by **providing sample screenshots of how you envision your application to look** (mock-up screen shots of the application interface) which must also include a **sample workflow demonstration of the typical usage and how easy it is to use**.

:::warning WARNING
Failure to provide the above mandatory components will result in no grade (submission will **NOT be graded**)
