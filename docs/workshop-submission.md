# Workshop Submission Procedures

**Individual logic** assignments and **video presentations** must be **emailed to your instructor**. Depending on your professor, you may also be submitting your **sub-group solutions** via email as well.

:::important IMPORTANT
In order for your work to be graded, you **MUST follow the below directions EXACTLY**.
:::

:::warning WARNING
Failure to follow the below directions, will result in **ungraded work** and a **ZERO grade be applied**!
:::

## Email: SUBJECT Line

- The email subject line must contain:

  - The full course code identifier (Ex: **APS145**)
  - Section code identifier (Ex: **NAA**)
  - Workshop identifier and number (Ex: **W1**)
  - Group identifier and number (Ex: **G2**)
  - Member identifier and number (Ex: **M1**)
    - Note: Do NOT include the member identifier part for a sub-group solution submission

- All characters must be **UPPERCASE** and should **NOT contain SPACES**
- **Example**: If you are in section ZBB and submitting workshop #4, in group #3, and are member #5, then you would use the following email subject line:

  ```
    APS145-ZBB-W4-G3-M5
  ```

:::important NOTE
Group work submissions do **NOT** include the last member part, so using the above example, the sub-group #3 submission would be the following:

```
APS145-ZBB-W4-G3
```

:::

:::warning IMPORTANT
This subject line convention and format **MUST** be used for all/any **work that is submitted via email**!
:::

### Pseudo Code

- The file you submit must be a raw/pure TEXT file that can be opened on any operating system using a basic text editor
- It must have the extension ".txt"
- The **file name** must contain two things:

  1. The logic identifier and the part number you are assigned (Ex: **logic2**)
  2. Followed by your full name (which can have spaces)

  **Example**:

  ```
  logic2-Your Full Name.txt
  ```
